Assignment: Dynamic Programming & Backtracking 

*Note: These problems are to be discussed as part of the Group Assignment. ![](Aspose.Words.de05e0c2-6ba7-4080-86ba-b6c7483baa1b.001.png)(Check this week’s Group Assignment on Canvas for details).* 

*The questions asked in this assignment – code implementation and time complexity of your code should be done individually based on the problem-solving strategy discussed within your group.  ![](Aspose.Words.de05e0c2-6ba7-4080-86ba-b6c7483baa1b.002.png)*

1. **Solve Dynamic Programming Problem and find its optimal solution.** 

Given a list of numbers, return a subset of non-consecutive numbers in the form of a list that would have the maximum sum. 

Example 1: Input: [7,2,5,8,6] 

`      `Output: [7,5,6] (This will have sum of 18) 

Example 2: Input: [-1, -1, 0] 

`      `Output: [0] (This is the maximum possible sum for this array) Example 3: Input: [-1, -1, -10, -34]

`      `Output: [-1] (This is the maximum possible sum) 

1. Implement the solution of this problem using dynamic Programming. Name your function **max\_independent\_set(nums)**. Name your file **MaxSet.py** 
1. What is the time complexity of your implementation? 
2. **Implement a backtracking algorithm** 
1. Write the implementation to solve the powerset problem discussed in the exercise of the exploration: Backtracking. Name your function **powerset.py**. Name your file **PowerSet.py** 
1. What is the time complexity of your implementation?
